/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMI's
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

GOOD LUCK!

var massMark, massJohn, heightMark, heightJohn;
massMark = prompt('What is Mark\'s mass?');
heightMark = prompt('What is Mark\'s height?');
massJohn = prompt('What is John\'s mass?');
heightJohn = prompt('What is John\'s height?');

var bmiMark, bmiJohn;
bmiMark = massMark / (heightMark ** 2);
bmiJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn ** 2);
console.log(bmiMark, bmiJohn);

var bool = bmiMark > bmiJohn;

console.log('Is Mark\'s BMI higher than John\'s? ' + bool);
